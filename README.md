# Maggie's Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University

## About Me
My name is Maggie Harger, and I am a second year student earning my Master's of Science in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Before coming here I worked in the greater Seattle area helping underserved communities acquire greater access to mobility services by working with public transit agencies. In addition to graduate school, I currently work part time for the US Department of Transportation as a Policy Analyst intern. In my free time you might see me running, eating good food, or biking around Pittsburgh.


## What I Hope to Learn...
By taking this course, I hope to learn how to select the best data for conveing a certain point or idea. Additionally, I hope to gain exposure to a variety of tools to help me visualize the data. It will also be interesting to learn some of the theory behind which types of charts are more effective than others.

When I graduate, I plan to get a job working directly in governments or with governments as a consultant. I would like to specifically focus on policy related to transportation and city planning.
