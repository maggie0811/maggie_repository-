# Critique by Design: Pittsburgh Regional Transit Trends

The goal of this assignment was to find a published data visualization that could be adjusted to convey the meaning in a more powerful way.

### Original Visualizations

For this project, I selected several simple data visualizations from [Pittsburgh Regional Transit's (PRT) Annual Service Report 2022](https://www.rideprt.org/inside-Pittsburgh-Regional-Transit/Transparency/surveys-and-reports/). The purpose of this report was to highlight service trends of this local transit agency in the year 2022. Specifically, I focused on trends related to ridership and crowding on buses, which is an important trend for the agency to focus on as they continue to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and it's impact on ridership.

The data was visualized in three simple charts, which attempted to convey meaning about how each route is recovering with respect to ridership levels and bus crowding levels. While the agency has a desire to return to high ridership levels, it also wants to ensure that people do not experience highly crowded buses, which it defines as not having seats available on any given trip.

The first chart visualizing ridership trends can be seen below. This chart is essentially a stylized table, which attempts to demonstrate low levels of passengers per revenue vehicle hour (PPH), which is essentially average passengers per hour. However, what exactly this metric is is difficult to discern by glancing quickly at the chart, and how the routes selected compare to both themselves and other routes in the system is difficult to discern from the visualization.

Additionally, the creator of the report wanted to convey information about the routes that had high levels of crowding. They visualized this using a simple bar chart. As with the first visualization, however, this chart makes it very difficult to compare the crowded routes with routes that had very low levels of ridership, and is overly simplistic. Additionally, the chart does not provide information about passengers per hour for these highly crowded routes, which makes it difficult to see if the routes are becoming too crowded for pandemic safety standards.

The full set of data was also provided in the report, with each route highlighted if it was achieving low performance standards in any measurement category.

Overall, the combination of charts and metrics, while potentially useful for understanding one single metric, makes it very difficult for the reader to get a good understanding of the larger ridership trends present in the agency. Additionally, the information conveyed in the chart could be very easily conveyed ina  written sentence or two, which made me wonder why the data was being visualized at all. The purpose of this critique by design is to create a single visualization that better captures the larger trends of the data, with the assumption that if a reader wants information on a particular route, they will look into the larger dataset.

### Stage 1: Sketch

I began by first sketching my idea for my visualization on a piece of paper. This helped me convey the general concept of my visualization, without spending too much time on the technical back-end before recieving my first round of critiques.
