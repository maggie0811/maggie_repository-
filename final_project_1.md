# Outline
My project will focus on a conservation effort in Olympic National Park in Washington State to relocate invasive mountain goats to the nearby Cascade mountain range, where they are native species. I am interested in this topic because I think it is a unique story, and one that has the potential to be told well with several visualizations. I am interested in showing several things with this project. First, I want to focus on the tracked damage that the mountain goats are contributing to the environment, as well as the potential risks they pose to human visitors in the park. Additionally, I want to focus on the trends in mountain goat populaition in the park throughout the years, as well as projected population growth. Then, I will focus on the removal strategy, and the level of success it achieved.

Many of the aforementioned metrics are available online in the Environmental Impact Statement EIS), as well as past research efforts to count the mountain goat population in Olympic National Park. However, a lot of the data is presented as simple tables or basic graphs in the report, or literally just in long paragraphs of text. This makes it a good candidate for a data visualization story. 

## Project Structure
This project will have three key features, the setup, conflict and resolution. The basic setup involves laying out the problem of mountain goats in Olympic National Park. I will provide data about the population growth, growth projections, and background information about the introduction of the species to a new environment. With respect to the conflict, I will provide information about the impact of the goat to the environment, as well as data about the encounters goats are having with humans, which is not good for the population. Finally, I will provide a resolution to the story, which is essentially information about how the removal program helped remove the goats from the park. Some of the goats ended up in other mountains, others were transfered to zoos, and some were killed.

The following image shows a general story arc diagram that I anticipate readers of the story to travel along:

Additionally, I have drafted a user story statement, which helps put the project into more context:

> As a reader, I want ta better understanding of the problems with non-native species in Olympic National Park, as well as efforts that are underway to address these issues, specifically with respect to mountain goats. This will enable me to make informed decisions about good wildlife management practices, as well as increase my knowledge of the current state of goat populations in Washington State.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
