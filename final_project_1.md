# Outline
My project will focus on a conservation effort in Olympic National Park in Washington State to relocate invasive mountain goats to the nearby Cascade mountain range, where they are native species. I am interested in this topic because I think it is a unique story, and one that has the potential to be told well with several visualizations. I am interested in showing several things with this project. First, I want to focus on the tracked damage that the mountain goats are contributing to the environment, as well as the potential risks they pose to human visitors in the park. Additionally, I want to focus on the trends in mountain goat populaition in the park throughout the years, as well as projected population growth. Then, I will focus on the removal strategy, and the level of success it achieved.

Many of the aforementioned metrics are available online in the Environmental Impact Statement EIS), as well as past research efforts to count the mountain goat population in Olympic National Park. However, a lot of the data is presented as simple tables or basic graphs in the report, or literally just in long paragraphs of text. This makes it a good candidate for a data visualization story. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
