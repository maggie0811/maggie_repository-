# Final Project Part I

# Outline
My project will focus on a conservation effort in Olympic National Park in Washington State to relocate invasive mountain goats to the nearby Cascade mountain range, where they are native species. I am interested in this topic because I think it is a unique story, and one that has the potential to be told well with several visualizations. I am interested in showing several things with this project. First, I want to focus on the tracked damage that the mountain goats are contributing to the environment, as well as the potential risks they pose to human visitors in the park. Additionally, I want to focus on the trends in mountain goat populaition in the park throughout the years, as well as projected population growth. Then, I will focus on the removal strategy, and the level of success it achieved.

Many of the aforementioned metrics are available online in the Environmental Impact Statement EIS), as well as past research efforts to count the mountain goat population in Olympic National Park. However, a lot of the data is presented as simple tables or basic graphs in the report, or literally just in long paragraphs of text. This makes it a good candidate for a data visualization story. 

## Project Structure
This project will have three key features, the setup, conflict and resolution. The basic setup involves laying out the problem of mountain goats in Olympic National Park. I will provide data about the population growth, growth projections, and background information about the introduction of the species to a new environment. With respect to the conflict, I will provide information about the impact of the goat to the environment, as well as data about the encounters goats are having with humans, which is not good for the population. Finally, I will provide a resolution to the story, which is essentially information about how the removal program helped remove the goats from the park. Some of the goats ended up in other mountains, others were transfered to zoos, and some were killed.

The following image shows a general story arc diagram that I anticipate readers of the story to travel along:

Additionally, I have drafted a user story statement, which helps put the project into more context:

> As a reader, I want ta better understanding of the problems with non-native species in Olympic National Park, as well as efforts that are underway to address these issues, specifically with respect to mountain goats. This will enable me to make informed decisions about good wildlife management practices, as well as increase my knowledge of the current state of goat populations in Washington State.

## Initial sketches

My initial sketches for the project can be seen below:

# The data

My data will be sourced primarily from two reports. The first one is the [Olympic National Park Mountain Goat Management Plan Final EIS](https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=329&projectID=49246&documentID=87542), which details current conditions at the park, as well as anticipated impacts of the program. This will help a lot with the "Conflict" portion of the story, because it has a lot of mid-project information about expected impacts of the management plan, as well as information about the interactions between the goats and humans. I will also be using the [Olympic National Park](https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/mountain-goat-capture-and-translocation.htm) website, which provides information and data related to the final counts of mountain goats removed from the park. Additionally, I will be using data from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2016/1185/ofr20161185.pdf) which has data on the historical counts of goats at the park, as well as projected population estimates from the time when the report was released. Finally, I will be using another [USGS Report](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1107/pdf/ofr20111107.pdf) to get numbers related to the native mountain goat population elsewhere in Washington.

# Method and medium
With respect to final presentation, I plan to create the charts primarily in Flourish, but may use Tableau if it seems like it is a better option for the specific dataset. I was thinking specifically of the heatmap I am planning to make. The method of presentation will be a story in Shorthand, which will allow me to incorporate my charts with other elements of the presentation, such as photographs and text.
