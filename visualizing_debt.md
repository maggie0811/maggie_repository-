# Visualizing Government Debt

## Figure 1: General Government Debt of OECD Countries in 2020

This chart shows how various countries compare to the average level of government debt-to-GDP ratio as defined by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This metric measures the gross debt of a government as a percentage of GDP. The gross debt is calculated as a sum of the following categories: currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.

This chart shows the government debt-to-GDP ratios between the years 1995 and 2021 for individual countries.

## Figure 3: General Government Debt of OECD Countries Compared to Average

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/12579526"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This chart shows the government debt-to-GDP ratios of each country in the OECD and compares them to the average debt for that year. Individual years can be selected.

Each of the above three charts highlights some information over other information. The first chart, taken directly from the OECD website, shows the general debt in an easy to read way, it is very easy to determine which countries have a higher debt ratio than others. However, this chart can only show one year at a time, which makes it hard to compare a country's debt over time. The second chart gives the debt ratio of all recorded years for each country, so it can easily be determined if a country is paying down its debt or not. However, it is a little challenging to compare countries to one another.

The final chart shows each country's debt as a proportion of a whole, and the year of interest can be chosen. This makes it helpful to see not only which countries have a large debt ratio, but for which year. The average debt is shown in red for each of the years where that data is available.

This final chart was made using Tableau, and visualizes each country's debt ratio for each year, and assigns a color based on the value. Countries with a debt ratio over 100 are colored orange, and the countries are sorted by highest average debt ratio.
