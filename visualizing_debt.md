This chart shows how various countries compare to the average level of government debt-to-GDP ratio as defined by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This metric measures the gross debt of a government as a percentage of GDP. The gross debt is calculated as a sum of the following categories: currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.
