# Final Project Part III

My final story looked at wildlife management techniques for mountain goats in Washington State, specifically Olympic National Park. The final story can be found on the Shorthand website [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/management-strategies-for-non-native-species/index.html)

# Changes made since [Part II](final_project_2)

Since the completion of my first wireframe iteration, I made quite a few changes to this story. One of the biggest things I got feedback on was adding more narrative structure to the introduction. I incorporated this by creating a GIS map of Washington State which included the national parks located there. I also provided some paragraphs of background about the state and the various parks in this section, to let the reader understand a little more about the ecosystems in the region.

Another key change I made was adding two different sections at the end for various types of stakeholders who might be interested in this project. I got feedback related to my intended audience, mostly along the lines that it should be very clearly defined. To do this I divided the possible audience into two groups: Those with a casual interest in the project, and those with a professional interest in the project. For the casual viewers, I provided basic information about ways to learn more about national parks or invasive species. For the professional viewers, I added links to some of the more technical documents for their reference.

I also made a handful of changes to my visualizations. For example, I got feedback on my "Frequency and Type of Mountain Goat-Human Interaction in Olympic National Park" chart that there was too many colors. I tried to reduce the colors, and also make them very similar shades of red. With this, I believe I was able to convey the similarities with the various categories of unwanted human interaciton, while still making the distinctions between these types of interactions. 

Additionally, I edited the "Population estimates of mountain goats in northwestern WA" visualizaiton to fill the area under the population estimates, as opposed to the population projections to make that distinction clearer. And I moved the alternative text labels for the heat map to the top of the visualizaiton, instead of the bottom so that viewers would immediately read that text when looking at the visualization. I also uploaded my original GIS map of the goat count data to ArcGIS online, which allowed me to embed it in the site and make the visualizaiton more interactive, instead of having a screenshot of the map.

Finally, I added some formatting changes to make certain statistics stand out, and added some more nice background images to help tell the story.

## The audience

For the audience of my story, I identified two personas. The first one would be a general viewer who might be interested in environmental issues or issues of invasive species. I wanted to make sure that the information was accessible to these individuals, because I assumed that they might make up the bulk of my audience. Not everyone is a wildlife management professional, or has a lot of technical knowledge of wildlife conservaiton. So I wanted to make my story as accessible and relatable as possible within those constraints. 

However, I also wanted to recognize that some individuals might be interested in some of the more technical aspects of the project, specifically wildlife management officials or other people in the enviornmental conservaiton profession. For these individuals, I tried to provide as many links and references to background technical information as possible, that way they could go into more research on their own if they wanted to. 

## Final design decisions

My first design iteration got relatively positive reviews. Most people said my use of images was a nice addition to the story element, so I tried to keep that aspect and incorporate some more images where possible. As mentioned above, I also tried to use color strategically, so when there was data within a text block that I felt was relevant, I used a different color for that portion of text. 

I originally made a small moodboard when doing Part II of this process. I found that very helpful when choosing a color scheme for the project, as well as picking a font and thinking about what visualizations I might want to use. I also felt that it was helpful to create my first wireframe in Shorthand, because this gave me a better understanding of the overall capabilities of the website, and how it may or may not limit my design choices. 

## References

In addition to the sources listed on my shorthand story, I wanted to link my [project base data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ml9NGy-noZBxltVhMKZLnKxLOUvLaZRJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104529300543497971182&rtpof=true&sd=true) to this page. All of these data points were taken from the various reports I referenced, however they had to be formatted extensively to fit into an Excel document. 

# Final thoughts

Overall, I found this project fairly interesting. It was nice to see how it progressed throughout the multiple iterations and edits I made to it. I do wish I had some time to learn more about some of the formatting in Shorthand, because it seems to be a fairly versatile website. It may have also been interesting to look into data about how the translocated goats are doing in their new home (for instance, are they surviving the translocation?) but I am not sure if that data is something that is being tracked or published. In terms of what I am most excited about, I think the incorporation of the visualizations into the story was something that was interesting to learn. It is nice to know I can embed visualizations from various souces into a website. 

I also got a good amount of positive feedback about my presentation for this story, so I was happy to hear that my ideas were conveyed clearly and in an easy to digest manner. Sometimes data can be difficult to digest, or presented in a boring format (as I saw in some of the initial government documents where I got my data sources from). It is helpful to know how even dry data can be used to tell an engaging and useful story.
