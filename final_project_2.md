# Wireframes / storyboards

To create the wireframe for my final project, I began to create a draft of the project in Shorthand. Overall, I wanted to convey the story of non-native species management in national parks, with a particular focus on the mountain goats in Olympic National Park in Washington State. The story is relatively unique, as approximately 500 mountain goats were transferred from one mountain range to another over the course of several summers. I felt that this would make a good story, and had the data in the form of several official reports to tell the story. The link to my wireframe version of the Shorthand template can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/management-strategies-for-non-native-species/index.html).

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My story is targeted broadly toward individuals who may enjoy experiencing national parks, people who are interested in environmental problems, or people who are professionals in the fields of wildlife or natural resource management. When I was first reading the reports about this project, I noticed that they were in a very technical, dense format, and not very applicable to the average reader. Even the webpages targeded for the general public were still long and somewhat difficult to digest. By creating this storyboard, I hope to help a wider community understand basic lessons about wildlife management and conservation, and understand ways to apply this knowledge to their own engagement with nature. 

Because of this, wanted to keep my audience relatively broad. In general, managing mountain goat populations, or any wildlife for that matter, is a relatively niche topic. If I focus too much on the details in my story, it will probably not appeal to many people, and thus not be as widely engaged with. I want to make sure that I do provide technical details for those who are interested, but present them in a way that does not inhibit other viewers from appreciating the story and coming away with lessons about environmental conservation.

# Moodboard

I did create a moodboard to develop some basic ideas for the font style, as well as the color theme I want to go with. I looked at a few pictures of mountain goats and the Olympic National Park online. I then selected colors from those images, as well as some graphics from the Canva website that I thought were nice. Overall I want to go with a more rustic, natural look, rather than a modern one since this is a story based in nature.
