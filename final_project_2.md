# Wireframes / storyboards

To create the wireframe for my final project, I began to create a draft of the project in Shorthand. Overall, I wanted to convey the story of non-native species management in national parks, with a particular focus on the mountain goats in Olympic National Park in Washington State. The story is relatively unique, as approximately 500 mountain goats were transferred from one mountain range to another over the course of several summers. I felt that this would make a good story, and had the data in the form of several official reports to tell the story. The link to my wireframe version of the Shorthand template can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/management-strategies-for-non-native-species/index.html).

# User research 

## Target audience

My story is targeted broadly toward individuals who may enjoy experiencing national parks, people who are interested in environmental problems, or people who are professionals in the fields of wildlife or natural resource management. When I was first reading the reports about this project, I noticed that they were in a very technical, dense format, and not very applicable to the average reader. Even the webpages targeded for the general public were still long and somewhat difficult to digest. By creating this storyboard, I hope to help a wider community understand basic lessons about wildlife management and conservation, and understand ways to apply this knowledge to their own engagement with nature. 

Because of this, wanted to keep my audience relatively broad. In general, managing mountain goat populations, or any wildlife for that matter, is a relatively niche topic. If I focus too much on the details in my story, it will probably not appeal to many people, and thus not be as widely engaged with. I want to make sure that I do provide technical details for those who are interested, but present them in a way that does not inhibit other viewers from appreciating the story and coming away with lessons about environmental conservation.


## Interview script

Overall, since I am targeting a wider audience who may be interested in preserving nature but not have much knowledge about it, I wanted to ask questions that got at the purpose of my story, as well as the ways they were interpreting the data. The below chart details my prompting questions, though I made sure that the interviews were a natural conversation, and let the person being interviewed share their feedback broadly.

| Goal                                                   | Questions to Ask                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Understand how users are interpreting the charts.      |   What do you think each chart means?                              |
| Learn if the story information seems relevant.         |   How do you like the story? How would you apply it?               |
| See what they are learning from the story.             |   What did you learn that surprised you?                           |
| Understand if there are any improvements I could make. |   What would you change about my story, if anything?               | 


## Interview findings
I interviewed three people for my user research. Two of the people were interviewed at the same time (Interviews 1 and 2), so some of the feedback from these interviews overlaps. Addiitonally, I added a few things to my wireframe, such as a map, that were the direct result of these interviews but are now included in the final draft submission of this state. Overall, the people I interviewed found the topic to be a fun one and enjoyed the pictures. They wanted more visuals of the logistics of this operation. Additionally, they felt that the data was presented clearly, but could be cleaned up a bit especially when it comes to words and technical language. 


### Interview 1
This interview was with a student my age, who is studying Public Policy. I went to this individual because I felt they would have good insights into what an average person might expect out of the story. They do not have an environmental background. 
>_What would you change about my story, if anything?_

"I would add a map to somewhere in the story, possibly at the beginning. I do not know much about the region where the story takes place, so it would be helpful for me to visualize where the goats are located and what that region looks like."
>_What do you think of the charts?_

"In general I like the charts. For the heatmap it is a bit hard to read the side text. Maybe you could simplify this, or add some type of symbol indicating what goal it is trying to meet."
>_Does the story seem relevant to you?_

"I think the message of how it is relevant to me needs to be a little clearer. At the end you could have a portion on simple actions to take to preserve natural habitats, for instance when people go on planes they need to be careful about not taking insects with them. But it is an interesting story!"

>_What did you learn that surprised you?_

"I learned that goats can be moved! I really liked the pictures in the presentation."

## Interview 2
This interview was also with a student my age, but who has a stronger data science background. I also chose this individual because I felt they would have insight into what an average viewer would experience with the story.
>_What did you think of the charts?_

"I think the charts are useful, but maybe still a little too technical. For example, the chart about human/goat interactions has a very long title. This should be changed. It is also a little hard to see the trend in this chart. I have to look at a lot of components to understand it, maybe it can be altered a little bit for clarity? You could also make the population projection chart animated, for more engagement."

>_Does the story seem relevant to you?_

"It seems somewhat relevant but some of it is a little specific. I think it would be nice to have additional information at the beginning to help understand more about the park. I agree with Interviewee 1, there should be some maps."

# Moodboard

I did create a moodboard to develop some basic ideas for the font style, as well as the color theme I want to go with. I looked at a few pictures of mountain goats and the Olympic National Park online. I then selected colors from those images, as well as some graphics from the Canva website that I thought were nice. Overall I want to go with a more rustic, natural look, rather than a modern one since this is a story based in nature.
